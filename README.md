## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
   [I didn't use any outside help other than that was provided in the tutorial.]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   [Creating a 'guess' function was a bit chellanging. I tried to do it myself at first,
   but it wasn't working, so I took a look at the solution provided in the tutorial,
   it turned out that I was close enough, I was just missing one logic to be implemented.
    I forgot to increament progress variable inside the 'guess' function.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   [I actually enjoyed working on this project,now I wonder more about web development and I want to explore more of it.
   I also wonder how HTML, JS and CSS are working togeather?]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   [I was thinking to add one more button in the game to trick the player,
   that player must not pressed it even if computer plays it, and if they do they lose.
   If I had more time I would have done that.]
